Student Handin System

Student Handin System is essentially the interface used by Commerce Faculty students in order to submit files to their various courses that require online hand-ins on the network server.

The application first locates the base network folder to use which it then maps as a usable drive on the local PC. Authentication on the student is then carried out making use of UCT's LDAP server. Once authenticated, a student's credentials are checked to see what courses he/she is registered for and if any courses have projects that are 'open' (i.e. allow for submissions) these are then presented to the student to choose from. Once a choice has been made, a Windows Explorer type application is launched, allowing the student to then submit their files.
